We didn't have too much time to work on our rover, so we had to use a
simple hueristic approach.  We rasterized an imaginary circle
surrounding the rover repesenting how favorable each direction is for
travel.  Boulders and craters cast crisp "shadows" onto this circle of
areas to avoid (darker as they get closer), and Martians cast fuzzier
ones, whose shap varies depending on which direction they are
pointing.  The rover factors in a bias to move toward the center and a
bias against turning around needlessly, and moves toward its best
direction.  This way, we got a very effective path-finding system in
very few (around 300) lines of code.

Had we had some more time, we would have liked to fit our rover with a
wall-following system so it could navigate mazes for relavtively
little extra effort.
