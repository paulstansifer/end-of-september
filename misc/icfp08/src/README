The rover uses occulsion of an imaginary circle surrounding it to
determine which directions are more favorable.  Things cast darker
"shadows" onto the circle the closer they are.  Boulders have sharp
shadows, and Martians have larger, fuzzier ones.  It factors in the
direction of the home base, and the diffculty of turning sharply, and
heads toward the least-obstructed direction.
