* For graceful JS degredation, how about this?  Every AJAX request is an intercepted a href or submit target, which then GETs or POSTs to the requested URL, plus an 'ajax=inline' parameter.  The return value is the new content, but if there's no ajax=inline, it's wrapped in a simple but functional page.  For things that would be complete redraws, it could make multiple requests: ajax=body, ajax=sidebar, ajax=topbar.
